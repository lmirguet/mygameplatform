# Epic 1 Retrospective

- Date: 2026-01-14
- Epic: 1 — Account & Authentication
- Status: Not accepted (missing web frontend)
- Stories completed: 4
- Previous retrospective: None

## Scope Summary
- Delivered backend auth APIs for sign-up, sign-in, and basic profile
- Added JWT verification middleware and profile endpoints
- Database updated with username and avatar fields
- Rate limiting and tests expanded for auth flows

## What Went Well
- API surface for auth and profile is testable and stable
- Services deployed successfully
- Codebase health is solid with tests in place

## What Did Not Go Well
- No web frontend exists for login, signup, or profile
- README deployment instructions are unclear and incomplete

## Acceptance & Stakeholder Status
- Epic 1 not accepted due to missing web frontend

## Testing & Deployment
- API tests executed and validated by user
- Services deployed successfully

## Risks & Blockers
- Missing web frontend blocks end-user authentication flows
- Deployment docs slow adoption and raise support burden

## Action Items
1. Build a web frontend for sign-up, sign-in, and profile (desktop + mobile)
2. Add end-to-end flow verification via the web UI
3. Rewrite README deployment section with complete, step-by-step guidance
4. Document required environment variables, ports, and migration steps

## Next Epic Considerations
- Treat a functioning web frontend as a prerequisite for further user-facing epics
- Keep deployment documentation aligned with any new services
