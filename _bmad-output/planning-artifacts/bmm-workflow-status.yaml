  I would like to create a multiplayer gaming platform. People will connect to it online through a browser (desktop or mobile). And they will create game sessions, based on the available games on the platform. At first there will be simple games such as checkers or connect4. Later there will be some more complex games with more than 2 players involved. People will also be able to connect to an existing game session in order to play with the others.
