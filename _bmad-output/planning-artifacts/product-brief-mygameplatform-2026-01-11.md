# Product Brief: {{project_name}}

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Executive Summary
We’re building a truly free, self-funded multiplayer board‑game platform for casual players who want to drop in for a few hours without paywalls or friction. Today, existing platforms gate play with monetization or slow lobby discovery; as a result, many casual gamers churn. Our vision: a frictionless place where anyone can create an account in ~2 minutes, immediately find or host active lobbies, and play reliably across devices at no cost.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement
Casual board‑game players face paywalls, upsells, or cumbersome access on current platforms, and often struggle to find an active lobby quickly. These frictions drive would‑be players to quit before they ever play.

### Problem Impact
- Casual players either pay or bounce; “just want to play now” moments are lost.
- Active lobbies are hard to find fast, so sessions stall and churn rises.
- Communities stay fragmented because players give up and leave.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
- Monetization-first: memberships, per‑game fees, or ads disrupt casual sessions.
- Lobby friction: slow matching and empty rooms reduce instant play.
- Not optimized for “come-and-go” casual use; onboarding isn’t truly 2‑minute simple.

### Proposed Solution
A self-funded, always-free platform that prioritizes instant play:
- 2‑minute account creation, no payment methods ever required.
- Immediate lobby discovery/auto-join plus lightweight host tools to start games fast.
- Cross-device access (web/mobile) with reliable reconnect so casuals can drop and rejoin.

### Key Differentiators
- “Forever free” stance backed by self-funding; no hidden monetization.
- Instant-play UX: near-zero wait to get into an active lobby.
- Casual-first reliability: reconnect-friendly, low-friction sessions for short play windows.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Casual Board Gamer “drop-in” persona (any gender, age ~12–80): plays ~1x/week for <1 hour on web/mobile; prefers simple classics or games learned in <2 minutes. Motivation: quick fun with zero cost or friction. Frustrations: paywalls, long onboarding, empty lobbies.

### Secondary Users
- Hosts who spin up a table for friends/family; same casual profile, need instant lobby creation and easy invites.
- Indie/long-tail publishers offering light ruleset games seeking free distribution without monetization barriers.

### User Journey
- Discovery: Word-of-mouth/invite link; lightweight SEO for “play X online free”.
- Onboarding: 2-minute account; no payment setup; pick a game and auto-join/host.
- Core Usage: Join/host in under a minute; play short sessions (<1h); reconnect if interrupted.
- Success Moment: “I clicked, joined an active table immediately, played for free.”
- Long-term: Returns weekly for quick games; brings friends via invites.

## Success Metrics

### User Success
- Onboarding-to-play: user reaches a live table and starts a game within 2–4 minutes of landing.
- Return behavior: weekly active use sustained by core casuals; ability to rejoin if disconnected.

### Business Objectives (self-funded, reach-focused)
- Community scale: WAU 100, MAU 200.
- Session liquidity: active lobbies available for instant join during peak casual hours.

### Key Performance Indicators
- Time-to-First-Game: median/95th percentile time from landing to game start within 2–4 minutes.
- Reliability (lightweight): reconnect success rate tracked; basic availability (monitor disconnect-induced churn).
- Engagement: WAU = 100; MAU = 200; sessions per active user/week (track baseline).
- Social growth: invites sent/accepted per week; invite acceptance rate.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features
- Account creation and instant play: 2–4 minute signup; join/host lobby quickly.
- Game set: Connect4, Checkers.
- Lobby & session flow: browse/auto-join open lobbies; host can start/end a session; basic fair-play enforcement (rules validation).
- Cross-device: responsive web experience (desktop + mobile browser).

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Chat/voice.
- Payments/monetization.
- Cosmetics.

### MVP Success Criteria
- Time-to-first-game within 2–4 minutes.
- Achieve WAU 100 / MAU 200 with active lobbies available at peak times.
- Stable sessions with basic fairness (rule validation); reconnect not required for MVP.

### Future Vision
- Add more games beyond Connect4/Checkers.
- Later: reconnect grace, stronger anti-abuse/moderation, richer social features.
- Optional future monetization/cosmetics if the “forever free” stance is revisited.
