wild,Quantum Superposition,"Hold multiple contradictory solutions simultaneously until best emerges through observation and testing - explores how all solutions could be true simultaneously, how contradictions coexist, and what happens when outcomes are observed"
wild,Elemental Forces,"Imagine solutions being sculpted by natural elements to tap into primal creative energies - explore how earth would sculpt this, what fire would forge, how water flows through this, and what air reveals to access elemental wisdom"
biomimetic,Nature's Solutions,"Study how nature solves similar problems and adapt biological strategies to challenge - ask how nature would solve this, what ecosystems provide parallels, and what biological strategies apply to access 3.8 billion years of evolutionary wisdom"
biomimetic,Ecosystem Thinking,"Analyze problem as ecosystem to identify symbiotic relationships, natural succession, and ecological principles - explore symbiotic relationships, natural succession application, and ecological principles for systems thinking"
biomimetic,Evolutionary Pressure,"Apply evolutionary principles to gradually improve solutions through selective pressure and adaptation - ask how evolution would optimize this, what selective pressures apply, and how this adapts over time to harness natural selection wisdom"
quantum,Observer Effect,"Recognize how observing and measuring solutions changes their behavior - uses quantum principles for innovation by asking how observing changes this, what measurement effects matter, and how to use observer effect advantageously"
quantum,Entanglement Thinking,"Explore how different solution elements might be connected regardless of distance - reveals hidden relationships by asking what elements are entangled, how distant parts affect each other, and what hidden connections exist between solution components"
quantum,Superposition Collapse,"Hold multiple potential solutions simultaneously until constraints force single optimal outcome - leverages quantum decision theory by asking what if all options were possible, what constraints force collapse, and which solution emerges when observed"
cultural,Indigenous Wisdom,"Draw upon traditional knowledge systems and indigenous approaches overlooked by modern thinking - ask how specific cultures would approach this, what traditional knowledge applies, and what ancestral wisdom guides us to access overlooked problem-solving methods"
cultural,Fusion Cuisine,"Mix cultural approaches and perspectives like fusion cuisine - creates innovation through cultural cross-pollination by asking what happens when mixing culture A with culture B, what cultural hybrids emerge, and what fusion creates"
